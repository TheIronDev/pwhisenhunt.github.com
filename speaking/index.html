<p>
    I thoroughly enjoy giving talks, which is probably a by product of being in graduate school. I'm currently giving talks that focus on one of the following areas:
    <ul>
        <li>Front-end Test Driven Development</li>
        <li>Web Application Performance</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    If you'd like me to speak at your next event, please <a href="mailto:phillip.whisenhunt@gmail.com">contact me</a> well in advance.
