    Hi! Thanks for checking out my website. I'm an entreupreneur and software engineer with a love for writing clean, maintainable, tested code. I'm currently fascinated with JavaScript design patterns and overall web performance. By far the best way to get in touch with me is through email at phillip dot whisenhunt at gmail dot com.
