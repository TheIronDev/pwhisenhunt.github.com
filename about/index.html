    Hi! Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Phillip Whisenhunt(<em>wis-n-hunt</em>) and I'm currently living in beautiful Austin, TX. I'm a programmer by trade and an entrepreneur at heart. I'm also a yogi, aspiring author, avid mountain biker, runner, foody, pesco vegetarian, etc. Feel free to connect with me on any of the usual media networks, although I'm not very active on them.

  I really enjoy meeting new people so if you're ever in my area(currently Austin, TX) feel free to reach out and we can grab a cup of joe or a quick lunch. By far the best way to contact me is through email at <a href="mailto:phillip.whisenhunt@gmail.com">phillip dot whisenhunt at gmail dot com</a>. Take care.
