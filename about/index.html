    Hi! Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Phillip Whisenhunt(<em>wis-n-hunt</em>) and I'm an entreupreneur and software engineer currently living in beautiful Austin, TX. I've had the privilage to work in a lot of interesting areas over the past few years, from researching iris recognition too visualizing the human genome over the web. However, I'm currently interested in JavaScript, Web Performance, and honing in on one of my many ideas to build a fantastic company. You can find me on all of the usual social networking websites below.
