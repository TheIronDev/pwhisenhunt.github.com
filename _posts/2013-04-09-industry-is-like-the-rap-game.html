I recently remembered this story and thought that I would share it. Years ago when I lived in Wilmingon, North Carolina, I would occassionaly see a sexy, black Aston Martin driving around town. I remember seeing the car and always saying to myself, "Damn, what the hell does he do?". Well, I found out one day while perusing the Computer section of Barnes and Noble.

<p>
A good friend and myself were looking for a book on Objective-C because we had just started an iPhone development company. As I was reading through the pages of one of the books a random guy, who looked to be in his lower 40's, walked over and grabbed a book in the same section.

<blockquote>
Stranger: Do you guys go to the university?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Me: Yep.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Stranger: What are you guys majoring in?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Me: Computer Science
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Stranger: Cool, what languages do they teach you?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Me: Primarily Java
</blockquote>
</p>
Insert more small talk here. . .
<p>
<blockquote>
Stranger: Do you guys want some advice?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Me: Sure.

Stranger: Well, you should learn as much as you can outside of school. Learn as many languages, systems, and tools that you can. Industry is a lot like the rap game. Do you know what I mean? In rap there are the real rappers, like the Tupac's and The Notorious B.I.G.'s, the guys that really did come from the hood, and then there are the guys that just imitate being a rapper. Industry is a lot like that. There are the guys that know the intricicies of systems, tools, and languages and then there are the guys that just use the systems, tools, and languages. If you wanna be successful in industry you gotta be the guy writing the stuff that everyone else uses and you gotta really learn the low level details no one else cares about. Once you do that you can name your price.

Me: What do you do for living?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Stranger: I'm retired now, but I use to do low level <insert crazy terminology> consulting.
</blockquote>
**He then spit out all of these crazy acronyms, which I had no idea what any of them meant, and described what he use to do. He seemed really passionate about his work.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Me: Damn, that's crazy you're retired. I bet you made a killing consulting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Stranger: Yeah, you might have seen me around town, I drive the black Aston Martin.

I then went on to ask if he'd like to grab lunch or if he'd be interested in potentially mentoring me. Unfortunately, he said that he really didn't have the time. Moral of the story, if you want to be really successful in industry, don't just use the tools and systems that everyone else is using, really dive into them and learn how they work. Be a real rapper.
