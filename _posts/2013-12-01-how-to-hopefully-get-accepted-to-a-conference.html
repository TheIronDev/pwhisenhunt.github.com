  For the past year I've been submitting proposals to various conferences with the hope to speak on topics ranging from Backbone.js Patterns to JavaScript Testing. I've submitted papers and proposals to conferences before in an academic setting, so I assumed that it wouldn't be that hard to get accepted. Unfortunately, I was surely mistaken. The first conference I submitted a proposal to was this years <a href="http://backboneconf.com/">Backbone.js conference</a>. I submitted a proposal to speak about Backbone.js Patterns and Tips, something that I thought everyone could benefit from. Unfortunately, I was <strong>REJECTED</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  After not being accepted into the <a href="http://backboneconf.com/">Backbone.js conference</a>, I tried my hand at one of the jQuery conferences. I submitted a proposal to discuss the current landscape of Frontend/JavaScript testing; Unit versus Integration, differences between Jasmine, Qunit, Mocha, etc. I decided to switch my topic to testing because the Pattern shenanigens that I submitted to the <a href="http://backboneconf.com/">Backbone.js conference</a> was a bit too advanced. Unfortuantely, I only had about 20 minutes to write up the proposal because I found out about the conference at the last minute. However, I figured this time it would be a sure thing since almost everyone is doing some form of frontend testing. And again, <strong>REJECTED</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  After being rejected from both the Backbone.js and jQuery conference you'd think that I'd give up, but I'm stubborn and don't like being told I can't do something. So, I submitted a proposal to the <a href="http://fluentconf.com/">O'Reilly Fluent Conference</a>. Since I'd failed to get accepted for Patterns and Tips and Frontend testing, I decided to take a look at what talks had been accepted. Quit a few talks that had been accepted where along the lines of "How we do X at Y" or some form of real world use case, so I decided to switch my topic to something that had been a royal pain in my ass, <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>, but there are some serious pain points you can run into, from integrating with legacy code to getting the Rails RequireJS gem to play nicely. Since I had banged my head against the wall with RequireJS on numerous occassions, I figured it would great to share what Patterns and Tips I'd been using over the past few months. Sadly, I was again  <strong>REJECTED</strong>.

<p>
  I think that most people would just give up by now. However, after the O'Reilly rejection I had a thought
</p>
<blockquote>
  "Since I can't seem to come up with a good enough topic, I'll use science to determine the most optimal proposal!"
</blockquote>
<p>
  Using science, let's look at the most frequently used words in titles and descriptions and let's also look at auto generating conference titles. First, let's pick out the conferences proposals we want to mine and grab data from them:
  <ol>
    <li><a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/presentations">Fluent Conference</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://backboneconf.com/">Backbone.js Conference</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://html5tx.com/pages/schedule">HTML5 Texas</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://environmentsforhumans.com/2013/javascript-summit/">JavaScript Summit</a></li>
  </ol>
  I whipped up some quick node.js code, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/pwhisenhunt/conference-proposal-generator">here</a>, to scrape the preceding conference sites for their titles and descriptions. Doing so yieleded 97 titles and descriptions. A quick analysis of the word frequency of both titles and descriptions shows the following results:
</p>
  <h3>Top 10 Most Common Title Words</h3>
  <canvas id="top-title-words" width="900" height="400"></canvas>
  <h3>Top 10 Most Common Description Words</h3>
  <canvas id="top-description-words" width="900" height="400"></canvas>
<p>
  From our initial results, it looks like mentioning "Web" and "JavaScript" in your title proposal is pretty beneficial, as those words are used in <em>~15%</em> of accepted titles and the words "Mobile" and "Application" should also help boost our chances. Given these initial results, a successful title would probably look something like "Building Mobile JavaScript Web Applications with Jquery and BackboneJS". Although this is somewhat useful, it would be even better if we could auto generate our title.
</p>
<p>
  To auto generate titles I began writing a Markov Chain, but noticed on Hacker News that github user <a href="https://gist.github.com/grantslatton">grantslatton</a> wrote one in Python to auto generate <a href="https://gist.github.com/grantslatton/7694811">Hacker News titles</a>. There's no use in re-inventing the wheel so let's just use what they wrote to auto generate our conference titles by feeding in our scrapped conference titles. Doing so yields some pretty awesome proposal titles, such as.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>meteor: a child could do it</li>
    <li>javascript complexity in ecmascript 6</li>
    <li>circus tricks with jquery plugins warm and common handheld devices</li>
    <li>angry birds of javascript and profit</li>
    <li>optimizing for fun and backbone and profit</li>
    <li>jquery-free javascript and object extension</li>
    <li>where's my jquery ui & mobile emails</li>
    <li>advanced architectural patterns for building large scale of gilt.com's view layer</li>
    <li>avoiding callback hell by rewriting javascript framework for designers 2pm ct</li>
    <li>media apis for the non-mathmatician</li>
    <li>meteor: a real website with javascript complexity in the web applications</li>
    <li>meteor: a first-class citizen on github</li>
    <li>beyond jquery plugins warm and express.js</li>
    <li>enterprise and mongodb for fun web components in action</li>
    <li>programming abstractions for api</li>
    <li>functional programming diversity</li>
    <li>whirlwind tour of modern app development 9amÂ ct</li>
    <li>meteor: a polyfill: automate deleting code risk management at twitter</li>
    <li>keynote with node, socket.io, and patterns with jquery plugins warm and backbone and toasty</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Surprisingly, a lot of these actually sound like decent proposal titles, such as "JavaScript Complexity in ECMAScript 6". Now that we have some proposal titles, the next step of this experiment is to choose one of the auto generated titles and try submitting it to an actual conference. I'll hopefully be updating this blog post with details of my accepted entry. But first, I'm going to write my own proposal one more time.
