My girlfriend has decided to make a career change to software development and she's starting out with Python. In the beginning of her Python class she was extremely frustrated. She would come to me frustrated as hell asking questions about how to solve X or Y and followed the socratic method of replying in questions; "What type of variable is X?" or "Why are you doing it this way?". She woud get even more frustrated and say that the answer isn't in the book or that she didn't understand what I was asking. I told her that it's a right of passage as a programmer to "bang your head against the wall" over one line of code, which she said was "bull shit".

Fast forward a few weeks and she's now doing awesome. I've continued to guide her in the right direction if she gets stuck, but that's all I do. Last night she hit a wall trying to search through a list of objects and do some operations on the objects; she was so probably 5 lines of code from the answer and she just started using objects. I couldn't give her anymore guidance without giving her the answer. I told her

"I know that you're really frustrated right now, but I can't help you. This is part of the learning process."

She stayed up for most of the night working on the problem and this morning she told me.

"Thanks for not helping giving me answer last night. Even though I was up for most of the night I learned how objects work and I learned a bunch of different ways to search."

The thing that most people don't realize about programming is that a book can't teach you everything you need to know. Programming takes practice and patience. More then anything else it takes tenacity and the belief that you will "get it".
