My girlfriend has recently decided to make a career change to software development and she's beginning her journey learning Python. Starting out in her Python class she was extremely frustrated and would often ask me questions about how to solve X or Y. I followed the socratic method of teaching by replying to her question in questions; e.g. "What type of variable is X?" or "Why are you doing it this way?". She would get even more frustrated and say that the answer isn't in the book or that she didn't understand what I was asking. I told her that it's a right of passage as a programmer to "bang your head against the wall" over one line of code, which she said was then told me was "bull shit".

Fast forward a few weeks and she's now doing kicking ass. I've continued to guide her in the right direction if she gets stuck, but that's all I do. Late last night she hit a wall attempting to search through a list of objects; she was  probably 5 lines of code from the answer but I couldn't give her anymore guidance without giving her the answer. I told her

<blockquote>
"I know that you're really frustrated right now, but I can't help you. This is part of the learning process."
</blockquote>

She stayed up for most of the night working on the problem and this morning she told me.
</p>
<blockquote>
"Thanks for not giving me the answer last night. Even though I was up for most of the night I learned how objects work and I learned a bunch of different ways to search."
</blockquote>

Most people don't realize that a book can't teach you everything you need to know about programming. Programming takes practice and patience. More then anything else it takes tenacity and the belief that you will "get it".
